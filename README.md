# Cookiecutter Template for Selenium Python on AWS Lambda

Use this project to generate a selenium python project
that can be run on AWS Lambda.

Why Lambda? You get a crawler that costs you money on runtime only.

This project is heavily inspired by this great [blog](https://robertorocha.info/setting-up-a-selenium-web-scraper-on-aws-lambda-with-python/)

## Why not using the serverless framework

It is easier to do it from scratch since I am adapting the code from [here](https://robertorocha.info/setting-up-a-selenium-web-scraper-on-aws-lambda-with-python/).

A pull request is welcome though.
